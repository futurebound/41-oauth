# Lab 33 ~ Redux Middleware

**Author**: Mitchell

**Version**: 1.0.0

# Overview
This lab is an exploration of creating and implementing custom `Redux` middleware. This application serves as an expense tracker and budgeting tool. 

# Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. If wanting to view tests, enter `npm install -D` into the command line. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.

## Components
```
App
  Provider
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems
           CategoryForm  -- for updating categories
           ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
            [ExpenseItem] -- list of ExpenseItems
              ExpenseForm -- for updating expenses
```

### App
This component is the highest level component of the application. It renders a `<main>` body section containing a few components: `<Provider>`, `<BrowserRouter>`, and `<Route>`.

### Provider
This component is imported from `react-redux` and is passed a `Redux` `{store}` as props.

### BrowserRouter
This component is imported from `react-router-dom` and is utilized to set up the routes for the application.

### Route
This component determines the components that will render for the various specified paths. For this application, there is a single `<Route>` to the `/` endpoint, and renders the `<Dashboard>`.

### Dashboard
This component renders a `<section>` containing the `<CategoryForm>` and `<CategoryItem>` components. It passes the forms `{buttonText}` and `{onComplete}` props. It conditionally renders category items only if it is passed categories from the store. If there are, it passes those items `{category}` and `{key}` props. 

### CategoryForm
This component renders a `<form>` with name and budget `<input>`s, and a `<button>` that dynamically renders text based off of whatever `{buttonText}` the component was passed as props. It captures form data entered by users with the `handleChange()` method, and updates store state with the `handleSubmit()` method.

### CategoryItem
This component renders `<div>`s for each individual component. It displays the component name, a `<button>` that deletes the item if clicked using the `handleDelete()` method, and conditionally renders a `<CategoryForm>` if the `<p>` tag describing the category is double clicked that is passed an update `{onComplete}` and `{buttonText}`. Upon submission of the update form, any fields that changed will be re-rendered in the component.

### ExpenseForm
This component renders a `<form>` element with two `<input>` fields, one for the expense name and another for cost, as well as a `<button>` that dynamically renders text based off of whatever `{buttonText}` the component was passed as props. It captures form data entered by users with the `handleChange()` method, and updates store state with the `handleSubmit()` method.

### ExpenseItem
This component renders `<div>`s for each individual expense. It displays the expense name and cost, a `<button>` that deletes the item if clicked using the `handleDelete()` method, and conditionally renders an `<ExpenseForm>` if the `<div>` is double clicked that is passed an update `{onComplete}` and `{buttonText}`. Upon submission of the update form, any fields that changed will be re-rendered in the component.
